Defeature Model BTS-3000 Program
----------------------------------
======================
README Documentation |
======================
Purpose:
-This program is designed to make the defeaturing process for
Adams models simple, easy, and fast. Usually the manual process takes hours,
whereas this program takes minutes.
-What does BTS-3000 stand for? Brendan's Time Saver-3000!

Developed By:
-Brendan Sting (Creator and Nexteer Co-op Intern)
-Note: I do have a university to attend and may not always respond.
When I get back to work during my work terms, I'll try to get back with you on your issue.

Required Software and Specs.:
-Windows 10 OS PC (64-bit preferred)
-Python 3.9.7 install (3.9 should work) [REQUIRED ONLY IF CODING]
-PyCharm Community Edition (OPTIONAL - Only for editing code)

Instructions on Use of BTS-3000:
-First, locate your CMD file of the Adams Model you want to defeature.
-Once found, open in with either Notepad or Notepad++ (which can be found using your Windows search bar).
-Then, save the CMD file in Notepad or Notepad++ as a .txt file instead by typing .txt at the end of the file's name.
-Next, move the TXT model file to defeature into your C: drive since OneDrive on your computer can cause issues with file permissions.
-Now that you have your model ready to defeature in TXT format, launch BTS-3000 program (To launch, download the defeature kit folder to your local C: drive. Once downloaded, go to inside the kit folder then click on dist folder, and double click the defeature .exe file).
**NOTE: If there is an upgraded kit version of the defeature model program, you should use it instead (always try to use the upgrades first)**
-Once it fully boots up (give it a few seconds), hit the "Browse..." button.
-Navigate to where you saved the model as TXT and select the model TXT file. Click open.
**NOTE: You should see your model appear in the text field now. DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IN THE TEXT FIELD.**
-Next, you need to provide a backup file name so the original model can be backed up before defeaturing.
-Enter the name of the backup file in the second field across from the label named "Backup File".
-DO NOT include any extensions in the name of the backup file except .txt (but even this is optional).
-Once all looks ready, click the "OK" button.
--If all checks out, a new window with a loading bar should appear.
-Let the script defeature the model for a couple of minutes; progress is tracked by the loading bar. (don't worry about the Not Responding in the window; it happens during backup phase)
-Once the loading bar is filled, it should display a completion message and give the location of your new defeatured model.
-Go to the directory given beneath the loading bar and open the TXT file in Notepad or Notepad++ again.
-Change the TXT back to a CMD via adding the .cmd to the file name when doing the save as.
-Also, your backup file should be in the same directory as your defeatured model.
-That's it! You can close out of the BTS-3000 now.
-You can open the CMD file in Adams View.

Future Support:
-There's always more that can be done, and that's where upgrades can come in!
-Use PyCharm to develop Python code and edit the BTS-3000 with improvements and additions.
-You can add new functionality or maybe find a way to improve existing functions!
-Comments have been provided in the source code detailing what each thing does. 
--It is recommended you learn Python before editing this code.
