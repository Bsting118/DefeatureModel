## Personal Statement
All defeature model scripts and assets have been made using Nexteer Automotive resources and thus are owned and IP of Nexteer Automotive. I, Brendan Sting, am the inventor of the defeature scripts and some GUI assets. 

Personal and educative use of the defeature script (all versions) is permitted, but any commerical or business use is NOT permitted and may be subject to legal pursuit by Nexteer (unless Nexteer Automotive themselves gives consent to use the defeature software for commerical, business, etc.). 

Permission to publicly display my defeature model project for Nexteer has been given by Brett Close.
Reason for permission: this is my Kettering University Co-op Thesis project.
